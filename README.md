# watermarker
Hey everyone! 
I've made a programm that puts any watermark you want(it better be around 200x200p or more) on any different images.

1st step. You should click on "ADD" button and choose your images you want to put watermark on. 
2nd step. Choose the image you want to see on preview and set the watermark size. 
If you want to change the watermark, go Resources\Images\ , and paste your watermark there, but it should be called "watermark" and be in png format.

3rd step. Click on "CHANGE" button and choose you output directory. 
Last step - click "START" 
You'll find your finished file where you have chosed your output directory. However, if you choose the same output directory as input directory, it will replace the old file with the new one.
It can also process a lot of files in one click. If there is a lot of images in process, it shows how many of them are left.
